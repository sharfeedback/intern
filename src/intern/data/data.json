Fexofenadine has a low propensity to block delayed rectifier K+ channels, does not prolong QTc interval. \n- Since it is minimally metabolized,no interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors have been reported. It is largely free of arrhythmogenic potential, but some cases of ventricular arrhythmia in patients with preexisting long QT interval have been reported. \n- Thus, it is not entirely safe in patients with long QT, bradycardia or hypokalemia.\n- Fexofenadine does not cross blood-brain barrier—does not produce sedation or impair psychomotor performance and is free of atropinic side effects. \n- It is rapidly absorbed, excreted unchanged in urine and bile, has plasma t½ 11–16 hours and duration of action 24 hours.\n- Dose: For allergic rhinitis 120 mg OD; for urticaria and other skin allergies 180 mg OD.\n # Properties \n- Have no anticholinergic effects. \n- Lack antiemetic effect. \n- Do not cross blood–brain barrier (BBB), hence cause minimal/no drowsiness. \n- Do not impair psychomotor performance. \n- Are relatively expensive. \n # Route and duration of action \n- p.o., 12–24 hours",

        "content": " # ANTIEMETICS(Prokinetic agents) \n- Domperidone crosses blood-brain barrier poorly. Accordingly,extrapyramidal side effects are rare \n # Mechanism \n- The antiemetic action is exerted mainly through CTZ which is not protected by blood-brain barrier \n- Because of poor entry into CNS, it does not block the therapeutic effect of levodopa and bromocriptine in parkinsonism \n- but counteracts their dose-limiting emetic action \n # Uses \n- it is a less efficacious gastrokinetic and not useful against highly emetogenic chemotherapy \n # Adverse effects \n-Are much less than with metoclopramide. Dry mouth, loose stools, headache,rashes, galactorrhoea are generally mild. Cardiacarrhythmias have developed on rapid i.v. injection \n # Dosage \n- Dose: 10–40 mg (Children 0.3–0.6 mg/kg) TDS ",
